## <small>IP-01</small> Output Ownership {#ip-01}

Unless otherwise agreed in the contract, methodologies, processes, templates, documents, and reusable assets produced in Co-op projects are in principle owned by the Co-op and managed as common assets.

## <small>IP-02</small> Client Delivery vs. General Asset Split {#ip-02}

Unless otherwise agreed in the contract, the Co-op retains "general method assets" that do not contain client confidential data or personal information (processes, templates, toolkits, course outlines, general components, etc.) as common assets. Rights and obligations for client deliverables are governed by the contract.

## <small>IP-03</small> Sharing Principles, Licensing & De-identification {#ip-03}

The Co-op may publicly release a portion of its outputs without violating client contracts, privacy, or confidentiality obligations. The scope and licensing method (e.g., CC, MIT, etc.) must be decided by General Assembly resolution, and the public version must be de-identified and archived before release.
