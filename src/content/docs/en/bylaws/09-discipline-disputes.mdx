## <small>DISC-01</small> Complaints & Mediation {#disc-01}

Members who have concerns about a decision process, financial allocation, conflict of interest, or labor arrangement may submit a written complaint. The Co-op shall hold a first mediation session and produce a record within **{params.COMPLAINT_RESPONSE_DAYS} days** (mediation group composition and procedure defined in supplementary rules).

## <small>DISC-02</small> Rule Violation Handling {#disc-02}

Violations of bylaws, confidentiality, or conflict-of-interest rules may result in, depending on severity: written warning, suspension, removal from project duties, required remediation or compensation, or removal from membership. The approval threshold for significant actions follows GOV-06.

## <small>DISC-03</small> Exit & Equity Settlement: Capital Buyback, Company Articles Take Precedence {#disc-03}

1. When a worker-owner exits or must withdraw shareholder status because they no longer hold worker status, the Co-op shall in principle use their **paid-in capital contribution** as the buyback/share redemption consideration (no premium).
2. The buyback/share redemption procedure, restrictions, and payment method must comply with the Co-op's articles of incorporation and company law. If the articles specify deductions, they shall be processed accordingly and recorded.
3. Installment payments may be arranged to avoid cash flow impact (number of installments and ceiling defined in supplementary rules and must not violate the articles or laws).
4. Labor compensation already incurred before exit is settled per time records/allocation tables. Post-exit new revenues are not distributed unless otherwise agreed by contract.
5. Common assets may not be transferred due to exit. Handover and data backup boundaries follow DISC-04.

## <small>DISC-04</small> Exit Handover Minimum Obligations & Data Backup Boundaries {#disc-04}

1. Exiting/removed members must complete minimum handover:
   - Project status and file locations
   - Deliverable versions and to-do lists
   - Necessary client communication handover (may not unilaterally delete or withhold)
   - Co-op asset return and permission transfer (equipment, accounts, folder permissions)
2. Personal data backup requires General Assembly approval and must be de-identified. Backups may not contain: client lists, pricing strategy, unpublished template/general asset libraries, or any content violating confidentiality obligations.

## <small>DISC-05</small> Removal & Damage Claims {#disc-05}

Serious violations of confidentiality, conflicts of interest, misappropriation of assets, or causing significant harm may result in removal by General Assembly resolution. The Co-op may legally and per resolution demand remediation, compensation for damages, or take legal action.
