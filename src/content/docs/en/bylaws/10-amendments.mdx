## <small>AMD-01</small> Bylaw Amendments {#amd-01}

:::note[Why a high threshold for amendments?]
The bylaws are the organization's foundational rules; easy amendment creates instability. The {params.AMENDMENT_THRESHOLD} threshold ensures amendments have broad consensus and protects minority members from having rules imposed by majority will.
:::

Amendments require discussion at the [General Assembly](/en/meta/glossary/#general-assembly) and passage by at least **{params.AMENDMENT_THRESHOLD} [worker-owner](/en/meta/glossary/#worker-owner) approval** (per GOV-06).

Bylaw amendments are [major matters](/en/meta/glossary/#major-matters); [associate worker-owners](/en/meta/glossary/#associate-worker-owner) have no vote on them.

## <small>AMD-02</small> Supplementary Rules {#amd-02}

Matters not covered in these bylaws are supplemented by supplementary rules. Supplementary rules must not conflict with the bylaws.

:::note[Supplementary rules shall at minimum include:]

1. Member development assessment form and conversion procedure
2. Work hours and settlement cycle, allocation table format
3. [Common pool](/en/meta/glossary/#pool) education subsidy application form, reimbursement, and priority
4. Competition list and case library (acceptable / requires declaration / prohibited)
5. External partner contract template and payment deadline rules
6. Asset lending registration, depreciation, and damage handling
7. Exit handover checklist template and timeline
8. Quote and payment templates (deposit, milestone, stop-work clauses)

## <small>AMD-03</small> Note: Alignment with Company Law & Legal Procedures {#amd-03}

:::note[Legal form reminder]
The Co-op is incorporated as a company under applicable law, which still requires legal procedures such as board and shareholder meetings. These bylaws serve as the supreme internal governance and distribution framework. For matters requiring legal procedures, General Assembly resolutions shall serve as the basis for proposals and execution, with necessary legal steps completed accordingly.
