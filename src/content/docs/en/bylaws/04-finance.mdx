## <small>FIN-01</small> Financial Transparency Principle {#fin-01}

1. The Co-op practices internal transparency. All worker-owners and associate worker-owners may review and monitor the Co-op's financial operations (flying members may view financial information related to their involvement). The Co-op is obligated to keep processes understandable, accessible, and up to date.
2. Financial information shall be presented in a clear, structured, and easy-to-understand manner; explanatory documents or verbal walkthroughs shall be provided as needed to aid comprehension.
3. Worker-owners shall jointly bear financial oversight responsibility, actively participating in financial review and discussion; unclear or questionable information should be questioned and explanation demanded.
4. Financial transparency does not mean unlimited disclosure. Sensitive information (such as client contract terms, pricing strategy, personal data, and external partner sensitive information) is subject to confidentiality rules (see FIN-05).
5. Worker-owners should regularly receive financial education and training to improve financial literacy and oversight capability; the common pool should also provide relevant resources and support (see POOL-06).

## <small>FIN-02</small> Scope of Transparency {#fin-02}

At minimum, transparency covers:

1. Total income and expenditure, assets and investments
2. Per-project allocation
3. All member salaries and insurance costs
4. Grants and self-initiated project funding
5. Estimated allocation for projects in negotiation or quotation
6. Other worker-related financial reports

The scope of transparency may be reasonably adjusted based on member needs and General Assembly resolution; sensitive information remains subject to confidentiality rules (see FIN-05).

## <small>FIN-03</small> Accounting, Budgeting & Reporting {#fin-03}

1. The Co-op shall maintain a traceable accounting system (income/expense records, project-by-project detail, asset registry).
2. Corresponding reports shall be provided at quarterly and annual review meetings.
3. Budget categories, closing cycles, receipt formats, and access controls are defined in supplementary rules.

## <small>FIN-04</small> Audit & Challenge Rights {#fin-04}

Any worker-owner or associate worker-owner may submit an audit request; the Co-op shall provide data and explanation within {params.COMPLAINT_RESPONSE_DAYS} days. Significant concerns shall be placed on the General Assembly agenda for resolution.

## <small>FIN-05</small> Confidentiality & Classification {#fin-05}

Client contract terms, pricing strategy, personal data, and external partner sensitive information must be kept confidential. External disclosure requires a General Assembly resolution and must comply with IP-03's principles on sharing, licensing, and de-identification.
