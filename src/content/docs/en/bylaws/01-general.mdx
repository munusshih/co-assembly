## <small>GEN-01</small> Name {#gen-01}

This organization is named **CoAssembly Design Co-op** (hereinafter "the Co-op").

## <small>GEN-02</small> Purpose {#gen-02}

The Co-op applies cooperative principles as the organizational method for collective work, establishing sustainable, transparent, and equitable mechanisms for design labor and resource distribution — advancing collective production and social responsibility through sharing, mutual aid, and mutual flourishing.

## <small>GEN-03</small> Core Principles {#gen-03}

The Co-op's operations and governance follow these core principles:

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Redistribution" icon="seti:todo">
    Income, resources, and opportunities circulate within the collective to
    reduce inequality and build stable working conditions.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Shared Governance" icon="approve-check-circle">
    Members are simultaneously [worker-owners](/en/meta/glossary/#worker-owner)
    and co-owners; power is held and exercised collectively.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Shared Responsibility" icon="heart">
    Projects are taken on by the Co-op; risk, pressure, and responsibility are
    borne collectively.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Fair Labor" icon="puzzle">
    Minimum acceptable quotes and working conditions are established; pricing,
    hours, and distribution are made as
    [transparent](/en/meta/glossary/#transparency) as possible.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Sustainability & Shared Knowledge" icon="open-book">
    Without harming collaborators or privacy, we accumulate knowledge and
    resources usable by the broader community.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Member Economic Participation" icon="rocket">
    Surplus supports sustainability, shared assets, and education; returns to
    members are based on labor contributions, not capital invested.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Education & Capacity Building" icon="laptop">
    Resources are invested in member education, training, and knowledge renewal
    to ensure organizational sustainability.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Community Care" icon="star">

    contribution to expand the social scale of redistribution.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## <small>GEN-04</small> Legal Form & Cooperative Operations {#gen-04}

:::note[Why a corporation?]
Taiwan currently has no dedicated statute for worker cooperatives. The Co-op adopts the corporate form to:

- Comply with current legal requirements (Company Act, tax law, labor law)
- Maintain flexibility and operability as a legal entity
- Still practice cooperative principles and governance internally
  :::

1. The Co-op is a **private limited company** (non-listed, non-publicly issued) registered in Taiwan, operating in compliance with the Company Act and relevant tax and labor regulations.
2. Although organized as a corporation, internal governance and distribution follow cooperative practices (shared governance, [transparency](/en/meta/glossary/#transparency), one member one vote, labor-contribution-based returns).
3. The Co-op does not publicly issue shares; shares circulate only among members and may not be used as investment instruments or means of capital appreciation.
4. The Co-op explicitly regulates governance structure, financial management, and member rights and obligations in its bylaws to ensure cooperative principles are practiced in legal compliance.
5. **All shareholders are Co-op workers; all workers are Co-op shareholders.** The [associate worker-owner](/en/meta/glossary/#associate-worker-owner) training period is the explicit exception (see [MEM-04](/en/bylaws/02-membership/#mem-04)).

## <small>GEN-05</small> Document Hierarchy {#gen-05}

1. These bylaws are the Co-op's highest internal rules.
2. The Co-op may establish supplementary rules to specify implementation (forms, templates, operating procedures, checklists).
3. Supplementary rules may not contradict these bylaws; in case of conflict, these bylaws take precedence.

:::caution[Regulations take priority]
If any content conflicts with mandatory law (e.g. Labor Standards Act) or these bylaws, mandatory law takes precedence. The Co-op shall use a [General Assembly](/en/meta/glossary/#general-assembly) resolution to propose alignment/amendment.
